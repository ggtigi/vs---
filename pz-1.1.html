    <h1>Vehicle</h1>

    A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>) is a machine that transports people or cargo.
    Vehicles include
    wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft
    (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and
    spacecraft. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <br>

    Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: <br>
    wheeled,
    tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for <br> road
    vehicles
    types, terms and definitions. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
