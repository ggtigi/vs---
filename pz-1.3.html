    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>

    A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form

    <div class="p"><p>ax<sup>2</sup> + b = 0</p></div>

    where <span class="r">a</span> and <span class="rr">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="rrr">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
    equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span rrrr>x</span>
    so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="rrrrr">x</span> there.

    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

    The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

   <div class="ba">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</div> 

    where <span class="d">a</span>, <span class="e">b</span>, <span class="f">c</span> are known values and <span class="g">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="n">a</span> can't be 0.

    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>   

    &pi; (Pi) times the radius (<span class="c">r</span>) squared:

    <div class="css">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></div>

    or, when you know the diameter ( <span class="j">D</span>):

    <div class="v">A = (&pi; / 4)&times; D<sup>2</sup></div>

    or, when you know the circumference ( <span class="z">C</span> ):

     <div class="cv">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</div>

    <h4>Intersection</h4>

    The intersection of two sets <span class="df">A</span> and  <span class="fg">B</span>, denoted by A	&cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the
    sets A and B. In symbols,

    <div class="pink">A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</div> 

    That is, <span class="dc">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap B if and only if <span class="dfdf">x</span> is both an element of <span class="fdfd">A</span> and an element of
    <span class="ffffc">B</span>.
