        <center>What is HTML?</center>
    </h2>

    <span class="ot"><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and
        web applications. <br></span>

    <span class="sp">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
        documents into multimedia
        web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
        appearance
        of the document.</span><br>

    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="color"> &lt;img
        /&gt;</span> and <span class="colorr">&lt;input/&gt;</span>directly introduce
    content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="colorrr">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information
    about document text and may include
    other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the
    page.

        <center> Markup </center>
    </h1>

    HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
    character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs
    like
    <span class="colo">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="lol">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent empty
    elements and so are unpaired, for example <span class="end">&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in
    such
    a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).


    <p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>

    The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program: <br>
    <span class="f">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> <br>
    <span class="fff">&lt;html&gt;</span> <br>
    <span class="cc">&lt;head&gt;</span> <br>
    <span class="df"> <span class="fgg">&lt;title&gt;</span>This is a title <span
            class="fvf">&lt;/title&gt;</span></span> <br>
    <span class="rt">&lt;/head&gt;</span> <br>
    <span class="ff">&lt;body&gt;</span> <br>
    <span class="fg"> <span class="bb">&lt;p&gt;</span>Hello world!<span class="b">&lt;/p&gt;</span></span> <br>
    <span class="vv">&lt;/body&gt;</span> <br>
    <span class="fgfg">&lt;/html&gt;</span> <br>
